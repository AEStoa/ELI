TacoSeasoning3,"To make this homemade taco seasoning recipe, you will need the following spices: Chili powder: Please note that this is American-style chili powder, which includes a mix of spices. (International readers, it is fairly mild and not cayenne.) Ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder and dried oregano: Pretty straight-forward. Paprika: I prefer to use smoked paprika, but you could also use standard or sweet paprika if you prefer. Salt and black pepper: I used fine sea salt and finely-ground black pepper for this recipe. Crushed red pepper flakes: To add a bit of heat. If you prefer a milder taco seasoning, you can leave these out.
